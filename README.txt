// Semester Project - explanation

For my Semester Project, I created an interactive to-do list that takes user input and marks tasks as done or deleted. This was perhaps the seventh iteration of my project, as I had grand dreams of coding a random poetry generator using APIs, a spin-the-wheel style decision-maker for daily activities, or a random to-do list generator using multiple users' inputs; however, to utilize an educational psychology term, those projects are currently out of my ZPD. I stuck with a basic to-do list (with some fun functionalities!) because I believe that if I can be comfortable with this framework, I can use it to build upon for future projects. Once I have a better grasp of JavaScript, I really would like to work on a random generator for a user-inputted to-do list, specifically around what to do when a user is having an anxiety attack (so they can use the list to store tricks that are helpful for them, and also receive suggestions from others). 

I created my To-Do list using a mix of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on Komodo Edit 11. I used these technologies because they are what I am most comfortable and skilled with; although the JavaScript may not as advanced as a JQuery or AJAX program, I was still able to use my knowledge of UI to package and deliver the JavaScript.

In my project, I tried to focus on the CS81 content around events--specifically clicking with buttons and list items. Although I am most comfortable with coding for data (such as with conditionals or loops), with JavaScript I am most interested in events, as they are what is needed to code interesting, interactive webpages. I focused mostly on click events, but in the future would like to explore more events, such as mouseovers and keydowns (I am planning on taking another online JavaScript course over the summer to try and clarify the content from the second half of this class).
